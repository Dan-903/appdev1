As a Manager: How would you handle the situation when a key team member faces a personal issue that affects the project timeline?
What steps would you take to ensure the team stays on track, and how would you communicate with both the client and your team?

I would check on the affected member how they're doing. 
Have an emergency meeting with the team about the situation 
and make sure that the tasks left by the affected member is delegated to other members.

Report the situation to the client about this situation and assure them that the project will meet the deadline.



As a Developer: If you were the one facing a family emergency, how would you handle the situation to ensure that it doesn't negatively impact the project timeline? 
What actions would you take to manage your workload, communicate effectively with your manager, and ensure the project stays on course?

Even when facing a crisis, I would not want to burden the team with my personal problem. I will work on the tasks and not disappoint my team.
I will still tell my manager that I am currently facing a predicament but would still continue doing my job.


What Could Have Been Done Better?: Reflect on how both the manager and the developer could have better anticipated potential risks and mitigated issues before they arose.
What strategies might have helped avoid this situation or managed it more effectively?

Have backup plans.
Have these tasks pre-delegated to other team members in case of a similar problem arises.
